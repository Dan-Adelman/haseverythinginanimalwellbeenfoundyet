    <span class="hidden-text">t in my wildest dreams did I ever think I’d have to update this website. I made it as a cheeky taunt to highlight how deep some of the secrets in the game go. When I made the site, I was primarily thinking about how it would take forever for people to solve the 4th layer and correctly identify that the main character is in fact a Mexican Jumping Bean. Both of those were discovered within the first month after release. Despite working with Billy on Animal Well for 3 years, I knew I never would have been able to figure either of these out without Billy explicitly spelling all of that stuff out to me.<br><br>

So I’m hereby admitting that I was wrong to underestimate the power of such a dedicated community. You guys plumbed the depths of Animal Well far more thoroughly than I could have predicted. I’ve spoken with Billy about secrets outside of the 4th layer and the identity of the main character, and at this point, all I know is that there are still things left to be discovered. I know a handful of them, but not all. Even Billy has forgotten some of the secrets he put in years ago. So I apologize if this is a bit of a copout, but I won’t be updating this site any further. The two big things that I assumed would be virtually unsolvable have been solved, but beyond that, your guess is as good as mine.<br><br>

I am so incredibly grateful to be able to accept this “defeat”. When I first started working with Billy, no one had ever heard about the game. If no one cared about Animal Well, the secrets would have remained undiscovered until the end of time. I think I speak for both Billy and Bigmode when I say that the fact that this community has come together and given Animal Well your love and attention means the world to all of us. Thank you.<br><br>
